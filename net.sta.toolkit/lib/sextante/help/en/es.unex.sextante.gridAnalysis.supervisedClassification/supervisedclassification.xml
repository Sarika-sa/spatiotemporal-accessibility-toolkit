		<element name="DESCRIPTION" text="This algorithm generates one thematic layer (classified) from a group of images, clasifying its values in groups (classes). All of these images should contain information of the same zone using different  parameters. The most common practice for this is to use different bands of a  remote multispectral sensor although this is not the only possibility.&#10;&#10;The module should be provided with information previously known about a part of  the input data so that it can automatically apply it over the rest of the area being analysed. In short, helping the module  by showing it some areas (called training areas) that are known beforehand and share common characteristics with the area being analysed (homogenous class). These characteristics are known as spectral signature of each class and this signature is obtained from a series of statistical analysis of the values found in each training area and in each input layer. Once this signature is known, it is used to assign values to other cells that have similar signatures. The following figure shows a diagram of the process of supervised classification:" description="Description" type="0">
