= Introduction =

Project that aims to allow the dynamic creation of potential path areas compatible with existing Java open source tools. The library is therefore fully compatible with the popular GeoTools library (version 2.6).

= Functionalities =

  * create equal ranges of potential path areas (e.g. one area for every ten minutes up to a chosen time limit) *OR* discrete ranges for single or multiple time values (e.g. two areas for 12 and 44 minutes).  
  * Create both rings or disk areas
  * Output either as contours (polylines) or as areas (polygons)

= Requirements =

  * Topologically correct network dataset with one attribute field (this field must be named _SpeedLimit_) for each network element representing the speeds in Kmph of the movement across it 
  * recommended that your system at least 2GB RAM (for large network datasets)

= How it works =

  * Calculate spatio-temporal distance from origin to all network nodes using Dijkstra Algorithm (using GeoTools graph library) 
  * Build a triangulation of these nodes
  * contour the triangulation using the values supplied by the user as the breaks
  * Polygonize (using Sextante) the contours if required to produce areas  
  * Output is in the form of a GeoTools FeatureClass which contains either the contours or areas with each object also possessing a time attribute.
  * Times to create these areas depends on number of unique break value and the speed of the system available, as a guide the three images below took 56 seconds, 7 seconds and 5 seconds respectively to produce on a system with 3.3Ghz and 8GB RAM.
