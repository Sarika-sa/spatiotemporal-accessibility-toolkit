Specific Functionalities:
  * create equal ranges of potential path areas (e.g. one area for every ten minutes up to a chosen time limit) *OR* discrete ranges for single or multiple time values (e.g. two areas for 15 and 45 minutes).  
  * create single or discrete of potential path areas, e.g. one area for every ten       minutes up to a chosen limit
  * Create both rings and disks
  * Output either as contours (polylines) or as Areas (polygons)

*Image Below : ranges for every 10 minutes up to a limit of 60 minutes for ZÃ¼rich*
