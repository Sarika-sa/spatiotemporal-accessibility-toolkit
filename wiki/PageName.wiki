= Introduction =

Project that aims to allow the dynamic creation of potential path areas compatible with existing Java open source tools.

= Details =

Specific Functionalities:
  * create equal ranges of potential path areas (e.g. one area for every ten minutes up to a chosen time limit) *OR* discrete ranges for single or multiple time values (e.g. two areas for 12 and 44 minutes).  
  * Create both rings or disk areas
  * Output either as contours (polylines) or as areas (polygons)

*Image Below : ranges for every 10 minutes up to a limit of 60 minutes for Zürich, Switzerland*
